On behalf of our team Id like to welcome you all today. This is Deepak Joshi from 
Information Technology department

our team has worked very hard and very sincerly on this project.
 so before moving a head I would request my
teammates to introduce themselves

Have you ever thought how are the adminstrative relations between the union and the state?
or have you ever thought what are the articles which are there in INDIAN CONSTITUTION that deals with the administrative relationship existing 
between the Union and the States, and also with the Central’s methods of controlling the States. 

If no then here we all four have prepared a presentation to have a deep knowledge of Adminstrative
relations between the union and the state.

so basically we will be covering many subtopics during this presentation 
We would like to first start with the introduction part

As we know that India has a unique blend of unitary as welll as fedralism 
means a type of goverment in which the same territory is controlled by two levels of goverment.

as the word fedralism has come into play I remember a quote stated by the Honnerable
prime minister of India Shri narendra damodardas modi that

Federalism is no longer the fault line of Centre-State relations but the definition
of a new partnership of Team India

It means that federal India is no longer a hindrance for better centre-state 
relations but rather it has given new hope to the mixed efforts of the Centre 
and states which may be referred to as cooperative federalism.

have you remembered that I have talked about some articles which are there in the constitution of india that deals with the administrative relationship existing 
between the Union and the States, and also with the Central’s methods of controlling the States.
